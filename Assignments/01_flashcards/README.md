# Flashcards!

Today we will be making a flashcard program. It's pretty straightforward.

It will have a few parts:

- Something to hold the "card", which will have:
  - the question
  - the possible answers
  - the actual answer

- Something to grab the user input which will:
  - take the user input
  - evaluate it and check if it's right
  - if it's right, move forward
  - if it's wrong, keep on the same question

- Extra credit:
  - what about scoring? How would we keep track of right and wrong answers?

## So how will we do this?
